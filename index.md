# To fork or to clone ?

# When to fork ?
  a copy in own Github repository.  contribute by sending Requests to the owner of the repository to Pull my contributions (industry speak is PULL REQUEST). 
  Can only be done in Github.
  
# When to clone ?
  get a copy in local machine - can be via Desktop.  Again, need to submit PULL REQUEST to originator to incorporate contributions if desired.

# What is good for beginner ?
  Well, fork from originator in Github and clone the forked repository to own local machine.  That way, can simulate the message exchange without bogging down the originator of the repository that you fork.
  
# What is a typical software development workflow ?

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chionger/Reflections/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chionger/Reflections/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
